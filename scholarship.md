# WSU Scholarship App

For this project, our group was tasked with updating an existing application. The application was originally created by a group of students at Weber State University as part of a capstone project.

Utilizing the .NET Upgrade Assistant, our group was able to upgrade the project from .NET 2.0 to .NET 6.0. The upgrade caused several bugs and errors that had to be resolved before it could successfully build again.
After completing that, we tackled minor bug fixes unrelated to the upgrade, ensuring the application could operate as intended from end to end.
Once the application was functional, we leveraged the Entity Framework in order to overhaul the project's models. This allowed us to simplify the database structure of the project and more easily migrate the database.
